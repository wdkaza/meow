## Instalation
<br>

⚠️It still has alot of bugs i would like to fix them before providing a way to install it⚠️<br>
For example there is no way to reset the config, you need to relaunch the entire thing and thats a light one.<br>
But if you'd like to see this project get finished someday give it a star and i will try my best to finish it⭐

I want to mention github.com/cococry/ragnar as ragnar's old code helped me understand alot of things,<br>
Make sure to check it out aswell!<br><br>
