## Instalation
<br>

⚠️It still has alot of bugs i would like to fix them before providing a way to install it⚠️<br>
For example if you close all windows on any desktop that is not "0" you will just lose control of the WM<br>
its an easy fix but there are alot of bugs i would like to fix and i want to add atleast a customizable bar before releasing meow<br>
But if you'd like to see this project get finished someday give it a star and i will try my best to finish it⭐

I want to mention github.com/cococry/ragnar as ragnar's old code helped me understand alot of things,<br>
Make sure to check it out aswell!<br><br>

## Bugs

- [ ] Launching firefox(maybe any window) has a small chance to spawn a 0,0 ignoring the wm(temp fix : force quit with ctrl+q and it only happends on startup for me sometimes)
- [ ] Firefox permission popup will sometimes spawn behind the window and firefox window needs to be focused to close it
- [ ] Anything related to EMWH may not work since its not supported yet
- [ ] TODO. Will be adding more bugs that i encounter later, should have started keeping track of that earlier
