## General information

If you will encounter any bug or will have any questions feel free to add me at discord 'wdd.'  
Default keybinds are afwul, i would heavily recommend changing them to your own liking  
You can find more details about the confing inside config.h
(from Fluorite) If java apps are clunky, you can add 'export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1' to your .xinitrc before meow execution   
also thanks for everyone who is supporting the mini project i decided todo, you are all making my day!‚≠ê  

## Bugs(not important category, some bugs are outdated)

- [ ] (Priority bug)Killing bolybar will not readjust the config to account for no bar
- [ ] (Priority bug)Firefox pop-ups act weird, spawning at old locations
- [ ] Opening too many windows in cascade/master having small windowGap, masterGap will result in windows flying off screen
- [ ] Cascade code is way too messy xD, doesnt affect performance, etc but would be nice to clean it up heavily
- [ ] exitWM doesnt clean up memory, resulting in crashing the next session after a few minutes or so
- [x] Launching firefox(maybe any window) has a small chance to spawn a 0,0 ignoring the wm(temp fix : force quit with ctrl+q and it only happends on startup for me sometimes)
- [x] Opening a sub window? maybe thats what its called of a window, example in discord [add file] will not map it(thunar) correctly for some reason
- [ ] While polybar is focused(for whatever reason) if you try to fullscreen it, wm crashes
- [ ] Fullscreening should probably unmap other windows, looks weird with transparancy
- [ ] TODO. Will be adding more bugs that i encounter later, should have started keeping track of that earlier
